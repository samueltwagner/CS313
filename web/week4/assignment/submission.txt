2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.
I really enjoyed figuring out the schema. I think the tables, primary keys, and foreign keys connect nicely.

I would like to have more descriptive tables that allow me to create a leaderboard between users as well.

4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I really enjoyed seeing how the Postgres SQL works.

Good databases have well defined entities with correct relationships between the tables. They also should have the correct types for each column.

2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
