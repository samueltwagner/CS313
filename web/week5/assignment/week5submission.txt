After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:

http://peaceful-chamber-08126.herokuapp.com/week5/assignment/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

https://github.com/samueltwagner/CS313/tree/master/web/week5/assignment

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.

I can only echo statements outside, before trying to access the database in the php code.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

The application is not functioning. I cannot display information from the database.
The select statements work in the database console. They do not echo on the page though.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

I loved the activity figuring out SELECT statements for the data set. I really enjoy seeing the database relationship between the workouts and exercises in my database tables.

6. Why should you create a separate user account for your application to access the database?

It's more secure to create a seperate account to access the database.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

2

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I think the database is working, but I could not get the data to display after several hours of trying.
