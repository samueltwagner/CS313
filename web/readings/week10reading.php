    <h1>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. This article leads you through basic concepts and examples of client-side form validation.

 

client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side

 

We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.
We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.
We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application (see Website security (Links to an external site.)).
 

Let's start with a simple example: an input that allows you to choose whether you prefer a banana or a cherry. This example involves a simple text <input> (Links to an external site.) with an associated <label> (Links to an external site.) and a submit <button> (Links to an external site.). Find the source code on GitHub at fruit-start.html (Links to an external site.) and a live example below.

 

The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in three main ways:

The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.
fetch() won't receive cross-site cookies; you can’t establish a cross site session using fetch. Set-Cookie (Links to an external site.) headers from other sites are silently ignored.
fetch won’t send cookies, unless you set the credentials init option (Links to an external site.). (Since Aug 25, 2017 (Links to an external site.). The spec changed the default credentials policy to same-origin. Firefox changed since 61.0b13.)
 

fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')

  .then((response) => {

    return response.json();

  })

  .then((data) => {

    console.log(data);

  });

 

Here we are fetching a JSON file across the network and printing it to the console. The simplest use of fetch() takes one argument — the path to the resource you want to fetch — and returns a promise containing the response (a Response (Links to an external site.) object).

 

This is just an HTTP response, not the actual JSON. To extract the JSON body content from the response, we use the json() (Links to an external site.) method (defined on the Body (Links to an external site.) mixin, which is implemented by both the Request (Links to an external site.) and Response (Links to an external site.) objects.)</h1>
